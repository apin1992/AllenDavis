        <h3>As A Mental Health Professional</h3>
        <p>
         I'm a dedicated mental health professional with a unique background and passion for making a positive impact on my clients and how they experience life. As a mental health professional, I believe it takes more than talk to move past the hardships that may be holding a person from living their best life. The hard work of building shouldn't be done alone. 
         <br />
         <br />
         My theoretical orientation of counseling and years of experience as a mental health professional with 1 bachelor's degree and three master's degrees and in the process of working on a Ph.D. in counselor education and supervision are just a part of the skills, I bring to support my clients to be their best, have the best and live their best life.  
          <br /><br />
          My mission is to help my clients develop beyond the concerns that may be holding them back. I will tirelessly contribute to the well-being of individuals by providing support, knowledge, and perspective. Whether you are seeking information, a different perspective, or a great conversation I'm here to help.

        <h3>As A Educator</h3>
        <p>
          Knowledge is power! Knowledge is one of the only resources that can gain value with the more people who have it. I'm devoted to instilling a love of learning in every student that I get to support on their educational journey. I firmly believe in the transformative power of education and its ability to unlock doors to limitless potential. 
          <br /><br />
        Guided by a master's degree in higher education administration from the University of Louisville and nearly 10 years of experience teaching future military leaders at the college level and future and practicing mental health professionals at the undergrad master's level I employ a variety of proven instructional strategies while always adding new ones. 
          <br /><br />
        Beyond the classroom, I am still an active process improvement leader and mental health professional. I believe in getting to know my students as people to see and bring out their best. I encourage the student to explore their passion with experiential learning outside the classroom to turn passion into practical progress. I strongly believe in forging a strong connection between home and school to the point I consider essential to the success of my students.  You don't need to go on an educational journey alone. See below the list of concepts that I can teach and tutor.

        <h3>As A Process Impovement Leader</h3>
        <p>
        I have been a dedicated process improvement professional who had the honor to serve on the US Army Bomb Squad (EOD) for many years. As an Army leader, I was committed to excellence in every mission knowing the standards are Initial success or total failure. The only way to maintain such a high standard with higher consequences was to continually find ways to do better and be better both personally and professionally. I maintain that I have an adept understanding of operational and tactical planning from inception to execution. My skills have been sharpened by a relentless pursuit of discipline adaptability and unwavering dedication to the principles of leadership and improvement. 
          <br /><br />
        My leadership philosophy centers around developing every individual that I work with or am adjacent to at the highest level possible. Developing people to a high level requires comradery, trust, and accountability not only to yourself but also to the people who support you. Every person on your team is a resource and has a role to play. Find their strengths know their strengths like you know your own. Manage the resources of human capital like you would fuel or ammunition because they are all going to get you to where you need to be.    
          <br /><br />
        Leadership and process improvement are the foundation of being able to manage life challenges whether you are on the battlefield, or the board room, in the classroom, or in the sports field. Dynamic real-time problem-solving and resource management will make all the difference in the moment and in the future. Informed by a master's degree in Organizational Improvement and Leadership from SUNY Potsdam, over a Decade of military service, and process improvement systems like Lean Six Sigma I analyze where the individual or organization is and the steps that need to be taken to get to where we need to be with innovative and world-class solutions. If you need to build teams and establish systems and policies to create better outcomes on the battlefield, boardroom sports field, or life I can help.
